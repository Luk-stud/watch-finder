Create a description that captures:
- Design style (sporty, elegant, rugged, minimalist, vintage, modern, etc.)
- Aesthetic personality (bold, refined, casual, professional, adventure-ready, etc.)
- Visual character (clean lines, complex details, geometric, organic, industrial, etc.)
- Target lifestyle (office wear, sports, diving, aviation, casual daily wear, etc.)
- Design elements (dial layout, case shape, bezel style, crown design, etc.)

CRITICAL RULES:
- DO NOT mention the brand name anywhere in the description
- DO NOT mention the specific model name
- Focus on what the design LOOKS like and FEELS like
- Describe it as if explaining the style to someone who can't see the brand
- Use descriptive adjectives about the design language
- 2-3 sentences maximum

Example good description: "A sporty chronograph with a bold, racing-inspired aesthetic featuring a clean three-subdial layout and tachymeter bezel. The design exudes athletic confidence with modern proportions and legible markers suited for active lifestyles."

Example bad description: "The Rolex Daytona features the brand's signature design..." (mentions brand)
