Test Fixed Recommendations: Verify LinUCB Improvements
====================================================

Tests that our fixes resolved:
1. Winner-takes-all expert monopolization
2. Consistent contexts for training/scoring  
3. Proper per-watch arms
4. Normalized centroids for true cosine similarity
