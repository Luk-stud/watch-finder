# Diversity Enhancement Summary
*Fixing overly similar initial recommendations*

## Problem Identified
After optimizing for faster exploitation, the initial recommendations became too similar, showing mostly clustered watches from the same experts instead of providing diverse options for exploration.

## Root Cause
The previous optimization was too aggressive:
- 60% expert recommendations from session 1 created clustering
- Expert recommendations within clusters were very similar
- Limited exploration (15%) wasn't sufficient for discovery
- No diversity constraints within expert recommendations

## Diversity Solutions Implemented

### 1. Progressive Diversity Strategy
```python
# NEW SESSION PROGRESSION:
# Rounds 1-3: HEAVY DIVERSITY (40% expert, 60% exploration)
# Rounds 4-10: GRADUAL EXPLOITATION (60% expert, 40% exploration)  
# Rounds 11+: SMART EXPLOITATION (85% expert, 15% exploration)
```

### 2. Brand & Price Diversity Filtering
- **Candidate Multiplication**: Get 3x recommendations from experts, filter for diversity
- **Brand Tracking**: Avoid showing multiple watches from same brand initially
- **Price Range Diversity**: Ensure mix of budget, mid-range, premium, luxury
- **Two-Tier Filtering**: 
  - First half: Strict brand diversity
  - Second half: Relaxed (avoid brand+price duplication)

### 3. Enhanced Exploration Sampling
- **Brand-Aware Sampling**: Prefer unexplored brands for exploration
- **Boosted Early Scores**: Higher scores for diverse exploration in first 3 rounds
- **Smart Selection**: Group unassigned watches by brand, sample diversely

### 4. Configuration Updates
```python
# BEFORE (too focused):
UNASSIGNED_EXPLORATION_RATIO = 0.15  # Only 15%
# Early session: 60% expert, 40% exploration

# AFTER (balanced diversity):
UNASSIGNED_EXPLORATION_RATIO = 0.20  # 20% for better pool
DIVERSITY_BOOST_ROUNDS = 3  # First 3 rounds prioritize diversity
# Early session: 40% expert, 60% exploration
```

## New Recommendation Flow

### Session Rounds 1-3 (Discovery Phase):
- **40% Expert Recommendations** (diverse filtered)
  - Get 3x candidates from each expert
  - Apply brand diversity filter
  - Ensure no brand clustering
- **60% Diverse Exploration**
  - Sample from different brands
  - Higher confidence scores for exploration
  - Mix of price ranges

### Session Rounds 4-10 (Learning Phase):
- **60% Expert Recommendations** (diverse)
- **40% Targeted Exploration**
- Gradual reduction of exploration factor

### Session Rounds 11+ (Exploitation Phase):
- **85% Expert Recommendations** (still diverse filtered)
- **15% Minimal Exploration** (maintain some diversity)

## Expected Results

### Improved Initial Experience:
âœ… **Brand Diversity**: 4-5 different brands in first recommendations  
âœ… **Price Variety**: Mix of budget, mid-range, premium options  
âœ… **Style Diversity**: Different watch categories (dive, dress, sport)  
âœ… **Visual Variety**: Less clustering of similar-looking watches  

### Better Learning:
âœ… **Broader Discovery**: More opportunity to find user preferences  
âœ… **Faster Specialization**: Still transitions quickly after round 3  
âœ… **Maintained Quality**: High-scoring recommendations with diversity  

### Technical Improvements:
- **Diversity Metrics**: Track unique brands per recommendation batch
- **Smart Filtering**: Multi-tier diversity constraints
- **Adaptive Exploration**: Context-aware exploration reduction

## Logging Enhancement
```
ðŸ“Š Diverse recommendations (session 2): 5 total 
(experts: 2, exploration: 3, brands: 5, exploration_factor: 0.67)
```

The system now balances **personalization** with **discovery**, ensuring users see diverse options initially while still learning preferences efficiently. This should eliminate the "all similar watches" problem while maintaining the fast learning benefits of the LinUCB optimization.
